# Identifying-fraud-from-email 
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. The data set comntains a total of 146 data points (individual names) and 21 features. From the 146 individuals 18 of them are labeled person of interest (poi), and 127 are labeled non porson of interest (non_poi). From the 21 features available some features have many missing values for example the feature "loan_advances" has the most missing values. In this project, I played detective, and built a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. Please see the deatail in the overview file (pdf or ipynb about the details of the project).
